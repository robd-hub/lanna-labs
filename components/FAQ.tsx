    a: "Most websites are delivered within 4 weeks from the kick-off call. Larger or more complex builds may take 6–8 weeks. You'll always have a clear timeline before work begins.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who owns the website when it's done?",
    a: "You do — completely. All code, design files, and assets are yours. There are no ongoing platform fees or vendor lock-in.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many revisions do I get?",
    a: "We work in rounds of feedback, and most projects are finalised within two. Because we start from a detailed brief, large changes are rare. We'd rather get it right than limit revisions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle hosting?",
    a: "We recommend and set up hosting as part of the project. We use fast, reliable providers (typically Vercel or similar) and hand you full control of the account at launch.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does payment work?",
    a: "Fixed price, split into two parts: 50% to start, 50% on launch. No hourly billing, no surprise invoices.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I need changes after launch?",
    a: "Small tweaks in the first 30 days are included. For ongoing changes or new features, we can agree a small retainer or quote per update — whatever suits you.",
